							<p>When you start your career, grab what may come offer and join an organization. Learn as
								much as possible in first 2 years.learn from peers, seniors and observe things
								meticulously.

								I started my career in Supply chain analytics domain after Mtech in Industrial
								Engineering and Mgmt in Indian service based MNC.

								After I completed 3.3 years, I knew I had to move to product based company for better
								salary, perks, free food, bonuses and learning. And once you stay longer in service
								based, moving to product is difficult as life becomes stagnant and appetite for learning
								curves become downward.

								My previous company boss tried to provide counter offer and salary matching, I told I
								won't accept it and I requested for notice period.

								My interview in Current company was of 5 rounds. It was the great decision to join a US
								based product based company and I joined with 80 percentage hike from previous company.

								I work for 12 hours in lockdown but I enjoy my work.

								LOVE YOUR WORK NOT YOUR COMPANY..</p>
